Hi, I'm Shyfa Salsabila — a final-year student at the Department of Electrical Automation Engineering, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), Indonesia. I’m expected to graduate in September 2025.

While my academic foundation is in Electrical Automation, I’ve grown passionate about Artificial Intelligence, with a strong focus on recommender systems. During my research internship at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, I had the opportunity to contribute to an AI-based recommendation project under the Mobilizing Information Technology Lab, Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering.

As an aspiring AI Engineer, I am currently deepening my skills in machine learning, deep learning, and personalized systems, with the goal of building intelligent and impactful solutions. I enjoy working on real-world challenges and continuously learning from both academic research and hands-on development.
